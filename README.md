## Example package

A simple package to use as a reference is `file`. It has dependencies and uses the GNU configure style (*which a lot of packages use*).

https://github.com/kisslinux/community/tree/master/community/file


## Generating checksums

Once you have packaged something (*and before the first build*) run `kiss checksum pkg` to generate checksums for the package.


## Committing changes

One package per commit unless the packages are very closely related (`linux` and `linux-headers`).

Commit rules:

* **New packages**: `<package>: new package at <version>`
* **Existing packages**: `<package>: update to <version>`, `<package>: bump to <version>` is also acceptable.
* **Other package changes**: `<package>: <changes>`
* **Merges**: GitHub's default format is acceptable, or just `Merge #<PR number>` should suffice.
* **Misc**: We leave that to the discretion of the author and/or committer.


## Pull requests

Ensure that the package builds successfully on your system before creating a pull request. If for some reason it **does not**, open an issue if assistance is needed.


## Linting

All package `build` and `post-install` scripts are subject to checks using `shellcheck`. Packages must pass the linter to be accepted into the repository. Exceptions can be made using `shellcheck disable=SCXXXX` with good reason.

## Code style

- Indentation is 4 spaces.
- Keep variables lowercase unless they're environment variables.
- Use `#!/bin/sh -e`.
- Use `/usr` as the prefix.

## Git packages

- Use `git+https://` and not `git+git://`.
