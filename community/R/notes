libiconv might be necessary, although it doesn't seem it 

TK, JRE might be requirements for particular R packages, so we won't 
worry about them for now: 

# Some specific R packages themselves require TK and JRE. R CMD javareconf 
# may be a useful command. 

BLAS and LAPACK / MKL will just make R process data *faster*, so it isn't 
necessary that we have a working implementation yet: 

# BLAS and LAPACK may be useful. --with-blas at configure enables support.
# OpenBLAS would probably be the go-to:
# http://www.openblas.net
# 
# We can link against Intel's MKL. Refer to:
# https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-mkl-link-line-adavisor
# 
# MKL_LIB_PATH=/path/to/intel_mkl/mkl/lib/intel64
# export LD_LIBRARY-PATH=$MKL_LIB_PATH
# MKL="-L${MKL_LIB_PATH} -lmkl_gf_lp64 -lmkl_core -lmkl_sequential" 
# ./conifgure --with-blas="$MKL" --with-lapack
# 
# (Don't need OpenBLAS with Intel MKL, I guess!)
