!! IMPORTANT !!

To start using sinit, edit
/etc/rc.d/sinit-launch-services.boot
And uncomment the getty function, and
Optionally uncomment the runit function
If you deem necessary.

sinit is installed as /usr/bin/sinit. It
can fully replace busybox init by running
the following command.

      kiss a | grep ^sinit | kiss a -

NOTE: If swapping from busybox init on a 
      running system, shutdown/reboot by 
      invoking 'busybox poweroff'. sinit's 
      poweroff/reboot utilities can't be of
      use until it is actually running.
