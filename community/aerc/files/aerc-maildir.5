aerc-maildir - maildir configuration for \fBaerc\fR(1)
.P
.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
aerc implements the maildir format.
.P
.SH CONFIGURATION
.P
Maildir accounts currently are not supported with the :new-account command and
must be added manually to the \fBaerc-config\fR(5) file.
.P
The following maildir-specific options are available:
.P
\fBsource\fR
.RS 4
maildir://path
.P
The \fBsource\fR indicates the path to the directory containing your maildirs
rather than one maildir specifically.
.P
The path portion of the URL following \fImaildir://\fR must be either an absolute
path prefixed by \fB/\fR or a path relative to your home directory prefixed with
\fB~\fR. For example:
.P
.RS 4
source = maildir:///home/me/mail
.P
source = maildir://~/mail
.P
.RE
