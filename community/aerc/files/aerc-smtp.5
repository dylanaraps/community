available:
.P
\fBoutgoing\fR
.RS 4
smtp[s][+plain|+none]://username[:password]@hostname[:port]
.P
Remember that all fields must be URL encoded. The "@" symbol, when URL
encoded, is \fB%40\fR.

The meaning of the scheme component is:
.P
\fBsmtp://\fR:

Additionally, you can specify an authentication mechansim like so:
.P
\fB+none\fR:
.RS 4
No authentication is required to use this SMTP server. You may omit the
username and password in this case.
.P
.RE
\fB+plain\fR:
.RS 4
Authenticate with a username and password using AUTH PLAIN. This is the
default behavior.
.P
.RE
\fB+login\fR:
.RS 4
Authenticate with a username and password using AUTH LOGIN. This is an obsolete
protocol, but is required for some common webmail providers.
.P
.RE
.RE
\fBoutgoing-cred-cmd\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the command to run to get the password for the SMTP
account. This command will be run using `sh -c [command]`. If a
password is specified in the \fBoutgoing\fR option, the password will
take precedence over this command.
